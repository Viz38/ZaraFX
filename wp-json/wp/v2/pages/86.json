As a result, the engine\u2019s design becomes simplified, and the contribution of thermal and mechanical losses to the overall cycle efficiency can be significantly reduced compared to conventional heat engines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.09.jpeg\" alt=\"Small-scale IE engines\" class=\"wp-image-313\" srcset=\"https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.09.jpeg 1280w, https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.09-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.09-768x432.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Small-scale IE engines<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>IE engines are the oldest types of heat engines, dating back to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. These machines were later replaced by more efficient, well-known water steam expansion machines such as piston steam engines and turbines. However, modern trends in energy sources used and energy conversion have led to the revival of this old technology. Over the past few decades, many IE engines have been proposed and studied again under different names and for different applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"676\" height=\"289\" src=\"https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Isobaric-expansion-technology.png\" alt=\"Worthington direct-acting steam pump.\n\" class=\"wp-image-157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Isobaric-expansion-technology.png 676w, https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Isobaric-expansion-technology-300x128.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Worthington direct-acting steam pump.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>IE engines offered by Encontech directly convert heat into mechanical energy in a convenient hydraulic or pneumatic form, which can be readily converted into various other forms of energy. Using a differential piston arrangement (a combination of two pistons with different diameters), the IE engine can deliver any pressure of the pumped\/compressed liquid or gas. These systems are almost noiseless, can be fully balanced, and have a simple, reliable, and inexpensive design. Some versions of the IE engines avoid typical technical problems associated with well-known thermal-energy-driven systems, such as failure of sealing components, lubrication, and wear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.10.jpeg\" alt=\"IE engine for CHESTER project\" class=\"wp-image-314\" srcset=\"https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.10.jpeg 1280w, https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.10-1024x534.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.10-768x400.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">IE engine for CHESTER project<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Isobaric expansion technology presents a promising solution for recovering and utilizing low-grade heat in mini- and medium-scale applications. It is very versatile, easily scalable and reproducible in all industries where there is a temperature difference &gt; 20 \u00b0C. Among the notable applications, IE engines show great promise as vapor-driven pumps and compressors due to their straightforward design. In such applications, heat can be efficiently utilized for direct pumping and compression without the intermediate steps of generating shaft power or electricity, subsequent transmission, and reconversion to mechanical energy, as commonly practiced in current industrial processes. These methods hold significant potential for replacing primary fossil energy sources with readily available low-grade heat, even at temperatures below 100 \u00b0C. High pressure pumps for water desalination, compression of hydrogen, air, ethylene and other gasses at high pressure and heat engines for generating mechanical energy (electricity) using geothermal, biomass and solar energy, waste heat of diesel engines, computer data centers as well as of SOFCs and LT-PEM fuel cells are examples of promising applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"628\" src=\"https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.16.jpeg\" alt=\"IE engine for SH2IPDRIVE project\" class=\"wp-image-315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.16.jpeg 1280w, https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.16-1024x502.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/encontech.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/photo_2023-11-11-18.27.16-768x377.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">IE engine for SH2IPDRIVE project<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The current status of IE technology and essential modifications to make IE machines competitive and cost-effective alternatives to state-of-the-art heat conversion technologies are presented in or publications:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Glushenkov, M.; Kronberg, A.; Knoke, T.; Kenig, E.Y.
